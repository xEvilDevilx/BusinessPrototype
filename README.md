# BusinessPrototype
The Business Prototype is a platform for creating software systems for any purposes. This platform is not completed, but I did some freelance job orders with this solution (information kiosk system, retail/orders/incomes-expenses/cash accounting software, source code of finished job orders is not included in repository).
